        I started my education life in 2008 in Elitar Gymnasium. Since beginning of the classes, I actively participated and got certificates. Then, in 2019, I entered ADA University. It was one of the best decisions in my life, and I am very glad to be here.
        Now, I am 3rd year IT Student, and there are almost less than 2 years to finish my undergraduate degree. When I was 2nd year student, I applied to the Employability Week in ADA University, and earned internship at e-GOV Development Center.</p>
